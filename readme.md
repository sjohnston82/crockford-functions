# Crockford Function Challenges

Douglas Crockford has a talk where he presents a series of functions to be implemented, twisting the minds of students until they grasp the power of closures.

I wrote tests for all of the functions to help learners work through the challenges.

## Instructions

Clone the repo, then open `SpecRunner.html` in your browser to see the results of the tests.

For each function, write a definition in `src/functions.js`. Refresh the browser window to re-run the tests.

Once you have all the tests passing, congatulations! You now understand closures in javascript!
